"# Simple-Search" 
This is a personal project 


I was always fasinated how google works and i wanted to see that for myself and whats a better way than creating one by yourself


So I did it. 



This is a search engine built upon the website 
books.toscrape.com Check them out Great website to practice webscraping 



i cant always keep this project live on the internet or can i?


To run this project locally:


• clone this repo
• upload the book.csv to the database in a table called book
• go to backend and run the app.py 
• go to front end and open the html file in browser



Future Plans:
maybe scrape the wikipidia and then add it to this 
or keyword search 
ill see what i can do 


:) thanks for reading!
